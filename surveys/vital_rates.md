survey_type: Monitoring Coral Colony Size and Condition as Fixed Sites Over Time
survey_description: Vital Rates Annotations are the annotations of coral reef models generated from Structure-from-Motion photogrammetric imagery are collected at fixed sites since 2014. Annotators collect data on the size and species of coral colonies at the site. This assists with tracking coral colony survivorship over time and has allowed a better understanding of coral response to environmental conditions, such as how colony size relates to the probability of their survival after coral bleaching events. Refer to InPort metadata records or SOP for more details.
